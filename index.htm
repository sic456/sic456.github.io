<H1>Hi, I'm <span class="emph">Sarah<span></H1>
<div>I started doing websites when I was twelve way back in the naughties and have recently picked this hobby up again. I have discovered that framesets are deprecated! But WHY? Anyway I will find my way around that and populate my corner of the internet with silly and interesting things. Thanks for dropping by.</div>
